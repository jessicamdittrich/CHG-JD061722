# Note Taker

## Objective
The objective of this challenge was to finalize a pre-coded project by using express.js to have notes taken, saved, and appear on page load. An added feature would be to have a note deleted.
## Approach
My approach was to write out the steps needed to complete this and then start coding.

## End Result

## Reflection
Following what I could do for this assignment, I have no idea what I'm doing and it's really frustrating.
